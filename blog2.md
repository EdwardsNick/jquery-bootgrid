# My First forays into the bowels of the JavaScript beast


### How I got my crash course in the Javascript Language
------------------------

First of all, just to be clear, as a developer going into this project I had little to no interest in web development of any kind. The worst kind of development job I could imagine, was as a web developer. With that said, read on...


So, in the process of creating a simple business plan management website for a school project I came to an impass with a question: Should I try to implement the plan as a html table with fancy css to 'seem' functional, or implement the table as a JavaScript table. Well, after only a few minutes of research, the choice was clear. There are hundreds of JavaScript table implementations, each with many of the features we needed in the box. Sorting, searching, hierarchical structure all done with this strange JavaScript magic. Or so it seems to the uninitiated. So, it was settled then, we needed a fancy JavaScript table to make our website stand out.

The search for a JavaScript table was more complicated than expected, however. Just before our first demo to the client, I discovered a table called 'treegrid'. It seemed amazing, and best of all it displayed the table as a tree of information, just like we wanted. I implemented it for the demo and received good feedback about it. But then there was an issue.. The treegrid hadn't been worked on for quite some time, and the documentation left something to be desired. Maybe it was time to find a more complete table...? So, back to looking for a table to use. After some searching, I found a table called dynatable. Dynatable had a very slick look and had so many cool features. It seemed amazing! But alas, for such a thoroughly developed table, and website to support it, the documentation was extremely difficult to understand, and sorely lacking in some examples with full code. I need those full code blocks, or class definitions with method usage, or something more to understand how to even get it running. In the end I had to take a pass on the dynatable, even with all its features... But then, what table did I use?


#### Welcome:  Jquery-bootgrid
Finally, I stumbled across a JavaScript table by the name of JQuery-Bootgrid. A JavaScript table implementation with fancy sorting, searching, hidden columns, and more. It even comes in the box with a decent amount of css work done because it uses the bootstrap library. But best of all, the documentation *seemed* very complete and the github seemed like it had an active community around the project if I needed help. I got it up and running without too much of an issue, and my team members were impressed. And then.. It all fell apart. Although it seemed like and active community, with issues posted only days ago, the one and only contributor had vanished from the internet without a trace six months ago. And on top of that, the most important feature of the table was missing... Simple filtering. Well, it's too late to go back now, there's not enough time to find another table, get it implemented, and build it up to what we need. Instead, I will simply have to delve into the beast and add the features myself.

##### My first pull request outside of schoolwork 
So.. After a few late nights of hashing out a lot of bugs that probably would've been very simple to a skilled JavaScript developer (things like undefined vs. null, determining whether an object has properties), I came out with a JavaScript table implementation that could filter things on a specific column. It seemed to work extremely well, and I realized: "Hey, what the heck, I may as well toss this up on the bootgrid github as a pr, someone else may find it useful". Apparently, it was, to a few dedicated bootgrid users. [See for yourself here][first]. I even got my first +1! I think,  "Wow, I hope that will be useful to them",  and move on, thinking my work with the bootgrid is done... HA! Yeah right...

##### So it turns out, we needed a lot more features
As the project went on, and with the final demo presentation looming, feature cramming really became an issue. I wanted our table to be the best the client had ever seen! Well, first of all, a requirement came down the pipeline that the table should be sorted alphabetically, but only at the  highest level of the business plan's hierarchical system (which we cut out and didn't have implemented in any way). Okay well, setting a new sort order should be simple.. No, it's not. At least, not as it stands in the bootgrid. So I guess I'm back to delving into the code once again. So, after some hard work, you can now set a new sorting function to be called on the table rows. Whew! Well, that's not all. Suddenly, I realize.. I have no way to set any constraints to how the filtering I developed matches things. It only deals in exact matches. So once again, I add a new feature the bootgrid. Adding greater than and less than constraint to the table. Perfect! That's it right? Wrong... One of the most basic things you would think any JavaScript table could do is missing!? You can't pull the data for a single row given some index or identifier? I guess I'll need to add that too.. Finally, it's the day before our big presentation, and it suddenly hits me... I think I can modify the table one last time to allow for an almost tree like structure, or the use of sub elements. So, with hours to spare I cram in one last feature to the bootgrid. And now, the bootgrid is at the level it is today.Then I made my most recent pr: a myriad of useful added features, and some updated documentation, so hopefully, someone else can use this too. [See the final PR here][second]!


#### Epilogue 
So, about the bootgrid in general: I actually had a lot of fun solving problems in JavaScript and adding a lot of helpful features to the project that hopefully will get used. It's unfortunate the developer has disappeared or else I might have considered trying to get him to allow me write access to the repo to make changes and continue development on the project. 

As for my feeling on web development... It's quite different now. I wouldn't say that I've totally changed, but I certainly don't think that web development is the worst thing out there. There are so many frameworks and libraries out there that make it easier, and the main thing about web development that I like is the simple fact that you get to see how your changes impact the feeling of a website or the user experience with it in realtime. 

With regards to the Open Source community in general, I suppose I have learned a few lessons. It seems that, a lot of cool things come from Open Source projects but many projects suffer from poor documentation and no explanations to help new and upcoming developers join the project. But maybe that's the point. Open Source projects want us developers to have the drive to add 8-10 new features to their project so they know we are (git) committed.

Anyways, the whole thing has been really fun, and hopefully, someone will find my contributions useful for a project they are working on
